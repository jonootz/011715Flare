It is a simpler version of the Online Advanced template. Although it is a basic template, the content and files have been designed to maximize single-sourcing capabilities. This template starts you out with two HTML5 targets and a skin that has responsive output. This means the content display changes automatically depending on the device (browser, tablet, or mobile phone). You can add other kinds of targets if you like."
